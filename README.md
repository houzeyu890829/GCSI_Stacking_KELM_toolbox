# Stacking_KELM_GCSI_toolbox
Matlab code for efficient stochastic groundwater DNAPL-source identification using SD-PSO-MC algorithm and bi-directional SIO-HKELM. The main program was named 'P_S_PSO.m' in the folder of 'SD-PSO with Metropolis Criterion'. Furthermore, a quicktest program was named 'P_S_PSO_quicktest.m' in this folder. The trained forward-HKELM model was named ' ES_model.m' and embedded in the 'P_S_PSO.m' as a function in the folder of 'SD-PSO with Metropolis Criterion'. The forward-HKELM model had 12 input variables and 8 output variables, and 200 training samples and 20 testing samples were listed in 'Syangben.txt'. The trained forward-HKELM model was in the folder of 'Inverse-HKELM', and it had 8 input variables and 12 output variables.
