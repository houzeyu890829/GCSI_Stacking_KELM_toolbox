# Stacking_KELM_toolbox
Matlab code for efficient stochastic groundwater DNAPL-source identification using a Stacking KELM and a H-BSPSS algorithm for the characterization of DNAPL contamination sources. The main program was named 'H_Homo_PBSO_EL.m' in the folder of 'H-BSPSS'. Furthermore, a quicktest program was named 'H_Homo_PBSO_EL_quicktest.m' in this folder. The trained forward-HKELM model was named ' ES_model.m' and embedded in the 'P_BSO_EL_L' as a function in the folder of 'H-BSPSS'. The forward-HKELM model had 16 input variables and 32 output variables, and 200 training samples and 20 testing samples were listed in 'Syangben.txt'. The trained Stacking-KELM model was in the folder of 'Stacking_KELM', and it had 32 input variables and 16 output variables, the main program was named 'Stacking_prediction.m'.
